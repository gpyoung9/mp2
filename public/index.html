            <p>I am an incredible athlete! I've been playing basketball, football, hockey, and soccer since I was in second grade. Since then I've also picked up golf, swimming, gymnastics, track, cross-country, water polo, actual polo, billiards, weightlifting, and underwater basket-weaving. I've been on the varsity team for all of these at every school I've gone to and I'm going to be competing in the next Olympics in all of these activities!</p>

              <p>This is a movie that my dad showed me and my brother when we were kids that I did not really appreciate at the time. As I grew older and watched it again I began to understand its themes and motivations and it quickly found its place in my heart.</p>

              <p>This is also a movie that my dad showed me as a kid. I've always loved this steampunk/fantasy type setting that exists in this movie as well as the atmosphere that it creates. The soundtrack used in this film is also something that has been dear to me for a very long time and does a great job of enhancing the environment.</p>

              <p>Every family has their movie series that they connect with. For some it's Star Wars, for others it's Harry Potter. My family has always been a fan of fantasy adventure so naturally we gravitated towards the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I've watched this trilogy well over 20 times in my life and still find as much enjoyment from it as I did as a kid. I remember always thinking that Legolas was the coolest character in the entire series because of his archery and natural suave. These movies are ones that I have the best memories of.</p>
